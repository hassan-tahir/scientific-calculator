# Scientific Calculator
Scientific calculator using modern C++


Circle class will have ‘radius’ as its data member and setRadius(), computeAreaCirc() as its member functions. The setRadius() function will set the value of its data member ‘radius’ in the main function. The computeAreaCirc() member function will compute and display the area and circumference of the circle class. 

Rectangle class will have ‘height’, ‘width’ as its data members and setLength(), setWidth() and computeArea() as its member functions. The setLength(), setWidth() will set the value of its data member ‘height’ and ‘width’ in the main function. The computeArea() function will compute and display area of the rectangle class.


You also need to create constructor of each class which will initialize its data members with default values.


For consistency of the assignment, source data of the class data members should be set as follows:

RADIUS = 5.6
LENGTH = 5.0
WIDTH = 4.0

Sample Screenshot of Output:

If the user selects option ‘1’.

If the user selects option ‘2’

If the user selects any other option.

After completing the calculations the program should prompt the user to perform the calculation again Y/N:

If the user does not want to perform any calculation. The program should terminate successfully.
